                   the thinning of the ice cover. The polarity of the

                   summarizing the variance and shifts in decadal drift
                   patterns. The 28-year circulation fields show a net
                   strengthening of the Beaufort Gyre and the Transpolar
                   Drift, especially during the last decade. The imprint
                   of the arctic dipole anomaly on the mean summer
                   circulation is evident (2001–2009) and enhances
                   summer ice area export at the Fram Strait. Between
                   2001 and 2009, the large spatially averaged trends in
                   drift speeds (winter: +23.6{\%}/decade, summer:
                   +17.7{\%}/decade) are not explained by the much
                   smaller trends in wind speeds (winter:
                   1.46{\%}/decade, summer: −3.42{\%}/decade).
                   Notably, positive trends in drift speed are found in
                   regions with reduced multiyear sea ice coverage. Over
                   90{\%} of the Arctic Ocean has positive trends in
                   drift speed and negative trends in multiyear sea ice
                   coverage. The increased responsiveness of ice drift
                   to geostrophic wind is consistent with a thinner and
                   weaker seasonal ice cover and suggests large-scale
                   changes in the air-ice-ocean momentum balance. The
                   retrieved mean ocean current field from decadal-scale
                   average ice motion captures a steady drift from
                   Siberia to the Fram Strait, an inflow north of the
                   Bering Strait, and a westward drift along coastal
                   Alaska. This mean current is comparable to

                   Taken together this suggests an associated rise in
                   sea ice deformation rate. A winter and spring
                   expedition to the sea ice covered region north of
                   Svalbard–the Norwegian young sea ICE2015 expedition

                   first-year and second- year ice now common in
                   themajority of the Arctic Basin. During the 5month
                   long expedition, the ice cover underwent several
                   strong deformation events, including a powerful
                   stormin early February that damaged the ice cover
                   irreversibly. The values of total deformation
                   measured during N-ICE2015 exceed previouslymeasured
                   values in the Arctic Basin at similar scales: At 100
                   kmscale, N-ICE2015 values averaged above 0.1 d21,com-
                   pared to rates of 0.08 d21 or less for previous buoy

                   defor- mation length scale and total deformation
                   developed over the season from 0.37 to 0.54 with an
                   abrupt increase immediately after the early February
                   storm, indicating a weakened ice cover withmore free
                   drift of the sea ice floes. Our results point to a
                   general increase in deformation associated with the
                   younger and thin- ner Arctic sea ice and to a
                   potentially destructive role of winter storms.},

                   through Arctic sea ice is determined by the thickness
                   and physical properties of snow and sea ice. Light
                   transmittance is highly variable in space and time
                   since thickness and physical properties of snow and
                   sea ice are highly heterogeneous on variable time and
                   length scales. We present field measurements of
                   under-ice irradiance along transects under undeformed
                   land-fast sea ice at Barrow, Alaska (March, May, and
                   June 2010). The measurements were performed with a
                   spectral radiometer mounted on a floating under-ice
                   sled. The objective was to quantify the spatial
                   variability of light transmittance through snow and
                   sea ice, and to compare this variability along its
                   seasonal evolution. Along with optical measurements,
                   snow depth, sea ice thickness, and freeboard were
                   recorded, and ice cores were analyzed for chlorophyll
                   a and particulate matter. Our results show that snow
                   cover variability prior to onset of snow melt causes
                   as much relative spatial variability of light
                   transmittance as the contrast of ponded and white ice
                   during summer. Both before and after melt onset,
                   measured transmittances fell in a range from one
                   third to three times the mean value. In addition, we
                   found a twentyfold increase of light transmittance as
                   a result of partial snowmelt, showing the seasonal
                   evolution of transmittance through sea ice far
                   exceeds the spatial variability. However, prior melt
                   onset, light transmittance was time invariant and
                   differences in under-ice irradiance were directly
                   related to the spatial variability of the snow

                   spring are a key component of the Arctic foodweb as
                   they drive early primary production and transport of
                   carbon from the atmosphere to the ocean interior.
                   Onset of the spring bloom of ice algae is typically
                   limited by the availability of light, and the current
                   consensus is that a few tens-of-centimeters of snow
                   is enough to prevent sufficient solar radiation to
                   reach underneath the sea ice. We challenge this
                   consensus, and investigated the onset and the light
                   requirement of an ice algae spring bloom, and the
                   importance of snow optical properties for light
                   penetration. Colonization by ice algae began in May
                   under {\textgreater}1 m of first-year sea ice with
                   approximate to 1 m thick snow cover on top, in NE
                   Greenland. The initial growth of ice algae began at
                   extremely low irradiance ({\textless}0.17 mol photons
                   m(-2) s(-1)) and was documented as an increase in
                   Chlorophyll a concentration, an increase in algal
                   cell number, and a viable photosynthetic activity.
                   Snow thickness changed little during May (from 110 to
                   91 cm), however the snow temperature increased
                   steadily, as observed from automated high-frequency
                   temperature profiles. We propose that changes in snow
                   optical properties, caused by temperature-driven snow
                   metamorphosis, was the primary driver for allowing
                   sufficient light to penetrate through the thick snow
                   and initiate algae growth below the sea ice. This was
                   supported by radiative-transfer modeling of light
                   attenuation. Implications are an earlier productivity
                   by ice algae in Arctic sea ice than recognized
                   previously.},

                   considerable spatial, temporal, and spectral
                   variability. During a field experiment at Barrow,
                   Alaska, we examined the horizontal variability of
                   spectral albedo and transmittance as well as the
                   vertical variability of in-ice radiance. Temporal
                   changes were monitored under cold conditions in April
                   and during the onset of melt in June. Physical
                   properties, including ice structure and
                   concentrations of particulate and dissolved material,
                   were measured to provide a context for understanding
                   the observed temporal, horizontal, vertical, and
                   spectral variability in optical properties. For
                   snow-covered first-year ice in April,
                   wavelength-integrated (300-3000 nm) albedos were high
                   (0.8) and spatially uniform, but there was
                   considerable variability in transmittance.
                   Transmittance at 440 nm ranged by more than a factor
                   of 2 over horizontal distances of only 25 m, owing
                   primarily to differences in snow depth, although
                   spectral variations in transmittance indicate that
                   absorbing organic materials in the ice column
                   contribute significantly to the horizontal
                   variability. Peak values of transmittance in April
                   were 1{\%} near 500 nm, decreasing at both longer and
                   shorter wavelengths. At the onset of melt in June,
                   the ice surface rapidly evolved into a variegated
                   mixture of melting snow, bare ice, and melt ponds.
                   Albedos were much lower and exhibited considerable
                   spatial variability, ranging from 0.2 to 0.5 over
                   distances of a few meters concomitant with the
                   variation in surface characteristics. Transmission
                   increased over the spring transition as surface
                   characteristics evolved to decrease albedo and as
                   in-ice structure was altered by heating to reduce
                   attenuation within the ice. The exception to this
                   trend occurred over a period of a few days when an
                   algal bloom developed on the underside of the ice and
                   transmission was significantly reduced. Variability
                   in the in-ice spectral radiance values was observed
                   between nearby sites in both first-year and multiyear
                   ice. While the radiance measurements are strongly
                   dependent on the incident solar radiance, under
                   similar solar conditions there was an observed shift
                   in the peak of the maximum in the spectral radiance
                   from 460 nm in clean ice to between 500 and 550 nm in
                   ice that contained particulates in the surface layer.
                   More impressive spectral shifts were found in an old
                   melt pond that had accumulated particles at its base.
                   Not only was there a strong shift in the spectral
                   nature of the radiance as a function of horizontal
                   distance, but there also existed large changes
                   vertically within the ice. The vertical variability
                   in the radiance attenuation coefficient was spatially
                   coherent with variations in both the physical
                   structure of the ice, especially grain size, and the
                   concentrations of particulate and dissolved materials
                   entrapped in the ice. Not surprisingly, the
                   short-lived algal layer on the underside of the ice

  abstract =      {The sea ice cover of the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas is
                   currently undergoing a fundamental shift from
                   multiyear ice to first-year ice. Field observations
                   of sea ice physical and optical properties were
                   collected in this region during June–July 2010,
                   revealing unexpectedly complex spatial distributions
                   of solar radiation under the melt-season ice cover.
                   Based on our optical measurements of first‐year
                   ice, we found the under-ice light field in the upper
                   ocean to be spatially heterogeneous and dependent on
                   wavelength, ice thickness, and the areal and
                   geometric distribution of melt ponded and bare ice
                   surfaces. Much of the observed complexity in
                   radiation fields arose because the transmission of
                   light through ponded ice was generally an order of
                   magnitude greater than through bare, unponded ice.
                   Furthermore, while many sites exhibited a consistent,
                   exponential decay in light transmission through both
                   ponded and bare ice surfaces, light transmission
                   under bare ice was also observed to increase with
                   depth (reaching maximum values ∼5–10 m below the
                   bottom of the ice). A simple geometric model shows
                   these transmission peaks are a result of scattering
                   in the ice and the interspersion of bare and ponded
                   sea ice sur- faces. These new observations of complex
                   radiation fields beneath melt-season first‐year sea
                   ice have significant impli- cations for biological
                   production, biogeochemical processes, and the heat
                   balance of sea ice and under-ice ocean waters and
                   should be carefully considered when modeling these
                   sea ice‐ related phenomena.},

                   information about the energy fluxes in the climate
                   and ecosystem. Currently radiative transfer problems
                   are usually considered in horizontally homogeneous
                   layers although it is known to be a crude assumption
                   in many cases. In this paper, we examine the effects
                   of a horizontally inhomogeneous sea ice layer on the
                   light field in the water underneath. We implemented a
                   three dimensional model, capable to simulate the
                   light field underneath arbitrary surface geometries
                   using ray optics. The results show clear effects of
                   the measurement geometry on measured fluxes obtained
                   with different sensor types, which need to be taken
                   into account for the correct interpretation of the
                   data. Radiance sensors are able to better sense the
                   spatial variability of ice optical properties as
                   compared to irradiance sensors. Furthermore, we show
                   that the determination of the light extinction
                   coefficient of water from vertical profiles is
                   complicated under a horizontally inhomogeneous ice
                   cover. This uncertainty in optical properties of the
                   water, as well as the measurement geometry also

                   models to propagate incident solar radiation in the
                   water column. In open water, estimating K d is
                   relatively straightforward when a vertical profile of
                   measurements of downward irradiance, E d , is
                   available. In the Arctic, the ice pack is
                   characterized by a complex mosaic composed of sea ice
                   with snow, ridges, melt ponds, and leads. Due to the
                   resulting spatially heterogeneous light field in the

                   is mounting evidence that multiyear ice (MYI) is a
                   unique component of the Arctic Ocean and may play a
                   more important ecological role than previously
                   assumed. This study improves our understanding of the
                   potential of MYI as a suitable habitat for sea ice
                   algae on a pan-Arctic scale. We sampled sea ice cores
                   from MYI and first-year sea ice (FYI) within the
                   Lincoln Sea during four consecutive spring seasons.
                   This included four MYI hummocks with a mean chl a
                   biomass of 2.0 mg/m2, a value significantly higher
                   than FYI and MYI refrozen ponds. Our results support
                   the hypothesis that MYI hummocks can host substantial
                   ice-algal biomass and represent a reliable ice-algal
                   habitat due to the (quasi-) permanent low-snow
                   surface of these features. We identified an ice-algal
                   habitat threshold value for calculated light
                   transmittance of 0.014{\%}. Ice classes and coverage
                   of suitable ice-algal habitat were determined from
                   snow and ice surveys. These ice classes and
                   associated coverage of suitable habitat were applied
                   to pan-Arctic CryoSat-2 snow and ice thickness data
                   products. This habitat classification accounted for
                   the variability of the snow and ice properties and
                   showed an areal coverage of suitable ice-algal
                   habitat within the MYI-covered region of 0.54 million
                   km2 (8.5{\%} of total ice area). This is 27 times
                   greater than the areal coverage of 0.02 million km2
                   (0.3{\%} of total ice area) determined using the
                   conventional block-model classification, which
                   assigns single-parameter values to each grid cell and
                   does not account for subgrid cell variability. This
                   emphasizes the importance of accounting for variable
                   snow and ice conditions in all sea ice studies.
                   Furthermore, our results indicate the loss of MYI
                   will also mean the loss of reliable ice-algal habitat
                   during spring when food is sparse and many organisms
                   depend on ice-algae.},

                   To increase the observational capabilities of sea ice

                   campaign in the Arctic in autumn 2016 to demonstrate
                   the vehicle's capabilities. The vehicle is designed
                   for efficient operations in the harsh polar

                   by three scientists simultaneously operating a wide

                   and biological oceanography are combined with optical
                   and acoustic sea ice sensors to provide a
                   comprehensive picture of the underside of sea ice.
                   The sensor suite provides comprehensive capabilities

                   new optical based positioning system. The ROV is
                   designed for deployments and measurements of the
                   irradiance field at a short distance below sea ice
                   bottom in landfast level sea ice at calm under ice
                   conditions. It is equipped with two cameras (front
                   and rear) for optical positioning based on reference
                   poles with LED lights below the ice. A third upward
                   camera is for guiding during deployment and
                   positioning. The ROV is equipped with spacer poles to
                   maintain a constant distance between ROV with onboard
                   optical sensors and bottom of the ice. All pre-tests
                   of housing, thrusters, optical positioning, and ROV
                   maneuverability were carried out in freshwater basins
                   prior to field trials and tests. These were conducted
                   at Kangerlussuaq, West Greenland on landfast
                   first-year 79–80 cm thick ice with a variable
                   (1–12 cm) snow cover in March 2016. The ROV was
                   easily deployed through a hole (75 × 50 cm) in the
                   ice and easy to maneuver below the ice. Test of
                   positioning system showed an average deviation of 28
                   ± 5 cm between optically based position and actual
                   position with an average offset from center line of
                   16 ± 5 cm. The ROV was applied for measuring the
                   under-ice irradiance field and results demonstrated a
                   solid negative correlation between snow depth and PAR
                   transmittance. We derived a Normalized Differences
                   Index (NDI) for snow depths: NDIsnow depth = [E(610
                   nm) – E(490 nm)]/[E(610 nm) + E(490 nm)] with
                   minimum attenuation at 490 nm and maximum at 610 nm.
                   It is discussed that the correlations for both PAR
                   transmittance and the NDI with snow depths are due to
                   a combination of a constant distance between optical
                   sensor and ice bottom, and accurate positioning. A
                   test showed that the wakes of thrusters removed parts
                   of the ice algae biomass, but the study demonstrates
                   the applicability of this ROV design for measurements
                   of the under-ice irradiance field below landfast sea
                   ice with a new optical based positioning system.},

                   with high temporal and spectral resolution are needed
                   for advancing studies of atmosphere-ice-ocean
                   interaction during different seasons. In particular,
                   more observations of under-ice irradiance are needed
                   to quantify fluxes through snow and sea ice and their
                   seasonality, because the vertical and spectral
                   partitioning of solar radiation are still among the
                   biggest unknowns in today's descriptions of sea-ice
                   related processes. Our current understanding of the
                   interaction of radiation and sea ice is based on only
                   a few data sets, yet this interaction is crucial for
                   describing such processes as sea-ice formation, snow
                   metamorphism, and snow and ice melt, as well as
                   biological productivity and abundance. A modern setup
                   for synchronous, autonomous, continuous, and high
                   temporal-resolution measurements of spectral albedo
                   and transmittance of sea ice is presented. The setup
                   is based on three spectral radiometers, covering a
                   wavelength range from 320 to 950. nm with 3.3. nm
                   spectral resolution. Sensors, data logger, and their
                   setup have worked well in several campaigns under
                   challenging climatic conditions. The longest campaign
                   lasted more than 4. months, without the need for
                   maintenance, and the sensors have shown good
                   performance related to surface contamination, one of
                   the most challenging aspects for radiation
                   measurements. Measured data are of high quality,
                   including details of spectral shapes and high
                   sensitivity to changes in observed snow and ice
                   conditions. All spectra are calibrated for absolute
                   readings, allowing applications in a wide variety of
                   snow and ice studies and their comparison. A sample
                   data set, collected over two weeks in the central
                   Arctic, is presented and shows how the vertical
                   partitioning of irradiance changes during the
                   transition from summer to autumn. The main advantage
                   of the system is its suitability for autonomous and
                   long-term observations over and under sea ice.
                   Furthermore, the setup is portable and robust, and
                   can be easily and quickly installed, which is most
                   valuable for deployment under harsh conditions and
                   also encourages short observation periods. Spectral
                   range and other technical features permit the
                   application of this setup for various
                   interdisciplinary studies, too. {\textcopyright} 2010

  abstract =      {The association of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba
                   with the under-ice habitat was investigated in the
                   Lazarev Sea (Southern Ocean) during austral summer,
                   autumn and winter. Data were obtained using novel
                   Surface and Under Ice Trawls (SUIT), which sampled
                   the 0-2 m surface layer both under sea ice and in
                   open water. Average surface layer densities ranged
                   between 0.8 individuals m(-2) in summer and autumn,
                   and 2.7 individuals m(-2) in winter. In summer,
                   under-ice densities of Antarctic krill were
                   significantly higher than in open waters. In autumn,
                   the opposite pattern was observed. Under winter sea
                   ice, densities were often low, but repeatedly far
                   exceeded summer and autumn maxima. Statistical models
                   showed that during summer high densities of Antarctic
                   krill in the 0-2 m layer were associated with high
                   ice coverage and shallow mixed layer depths, among
                   other factors. In autumn and winter, density was
                   related to hydrographical parameters. Average
                   under-ice densities from the 0-2 m layer were higher
                   than corresponding values from the 0-200 m layer
                   collected with Rectangular Midwater Trawls (RMT) in
                   summer. In winter, under-ice densities far surpassed
                   maximum 0-200 m densities on several occasions. This
                   indicates that the importance of the ice-water
                   interface layer may be under-estimated by the pelagic
                   nets and sonars commonly used to estimate the
                   population size of Antarctic krill for management
                   purposes, due to their limited ability to sample this
                   habitat. Our results provide evidence for an almost
                   year-round association of Antarctic krill with the
                   under-ice habitat, hundreds of kilometres into the
                   ice-covered area of the Lazarev Sea. Local
                   concentrations of postlarval Antarctic krill under
                   winter sea ice suggest that sea ice biota are
                   important for their winter survival. These findings
                   emphasise the susceptibility of an ecological key
                   species to changing sea ice habitats, suggesting
                   potential ramifications on Antarctic ecosystems
                   induced by climate change.},

                   fundamentally important for projecting changes to sea
                   ice ecosystems, as the physical environment continues
                   to change. In this study, we developed upon
                   previously established methodologies for deriving sea
                   ice-algal chlorophyll a concentrations (chl a) from
                   spectral radiation measurements, and applied these to
                   larger-scale spectral surveys. We conducted four
                   different under-ice spectral measurements:
                   irradiance, radiance, transmittance, and
                   transflectance, and applied three statistical
                   approaches: Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF),
                   Normalized Difference Indices (NDI), and multi-NDI.
                   We developed models based on ice core chl a and
                   coincident spectral irradiance/transmittance (N = 49)
                   and radiance/transflectance (N = 50) measurements
                   conducted during two cruises to the central Arctic
                   Ocean in 2011 and 2012. These reference models were
                   ranked based on two criteria: mean robustness R2 and
                   true prediction error estimates. For estimating the
                   biomass of a large-scale data set, the EOF approach
                   performed better than the NDI, due to its ability to
                   account for the high variability of environmental
                   properties experienced over large areas. Based on
                   robustness and true prediction error, the three most
                   reliable models, EOF-transmittance,
                   EOF-transflectance, and NDI-transmittance, were
                   applied to two remotely operated vehicle (ROV) and
                   two Surface and Under-Ice Trawl (SUIT) spectral
                   radiation surveys. In these larger-scale chl a
                   estimates, EOF-transmittance showed the best fit to
                   ice core chl a. Application of our most reliable
                   model, EOF-transmittance, to an 85 m horizontal ROV
                   transect revealed large differences compared to
                   published biomass estimates from the same site with
                   important implications for projections of Arctic-wide
                   ice-algal biomass and primary production.

  abstract =      {In March 2003, a field validation campaign was
                   conducted on the sea ice near Barrow, AK. The goal of
                   this campaign was to produce an extensive dataset of
                   sea ice thickness and snow properties (depth and
                   stratigraphy) against which remote sensing products
                   collected by aircraft and satellite could be
                   compared. Chief among these were products from the
                   Polarimetric Scanning Radiometer (PSR) flown aboard a
                   NASA P-3B aircraft and the Aqua Advanced Microwave
                   Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System
                   (AMSR-E). The data were collected in four field
                   areas: three on the coastal sea ice near Barrow, AK,
                   and the fourth out on the open ice pack 175 km
                   northeast of Barrow. The snow depth ranged from
                   9.4-20.8 cm in coastal areas (n=9881 for three areas)
                   with the thinnest snow on ice that had formed late in
                   the winter. Out in the main pack ice, the snow was
                   20.6 cm deep (n=1906). The ice in all four areas
                   ranged from 138-219 cm thick (n=1952), with the lower
                   value again where the ice had formed late in the
                   winter. Snow layer and grain characteristics observed
                   in 118 snow pits indicated that 44{\%} of observed
                   snow layers were depth hoar; 46{\%} were wind slab.
                   Snow and ice measurements were keyed to photomosaics
                   produced from low-altitude vertical aerial
                   photographs. Using these, and a distinctive three-way
                   relationship between ice roughness, snow surface
                   characteristics, and snow depth, strip maps of snow
                   depth, each about 2 km wide, were produced bracketing
                   the traverse lines. These maps contain an
                   unprecedented level of snow depth detail against
                   which to compare remote sensing products. The maps
                   are used in other papers in this special issue to
                   examine the retrieval of snow properties from the PSR
                   and AMSR-E sensors},

                   Second, a new algorithm enables estimation of sea ice
                   concentration from the channels near 90 GHz, despite
                   the enhanced atmospheric influence in these channels.
                   This allows full exploitation of their horizontal
                   resolution, which is up to 4 times finer than that of
                   the channels near 19 and 37 GHz, the frequencies used
                   by the most widespread algorithms for sea ice
                   retrieval, the NASA-Team and Bootstrap algorithms.
                   The ASI algorithm used combines a model for
                   retrieving the sea ice concentration from SSM/I
                   85-GHz data proposed by Svendsen et al. (1987) with
                   an ocean mask derived from the 18-, 23-, and 37-GHz
                   AMSR-E data using weather filters. During two ship
                   campaigns, the correlation of ASI, NASA-Team 2, and
                   Bootstrap algorithms ice concentrations with bridge
                   observations were 0.80, 0.79, and 0.81, respectively.
                   Systematic differences over the complete AMSR-E
                   period (2002–2006) between ASI and NASA-Team 2 are
                   below −2 ± 8.8{\%}, and between ASI and Bootstrap
                   are 1.7 ± 10.8{\%}. Among the geophysical
                   implications of the ASI algorithm are: (1) Its higher
                   spatial resolution allows better estimation of
                   crucial variables in numerical atmospheric and ocean
                   models, for example, the heat flux between ocean and
                   atmosphere, especially near coastlines and in
                   polynyas. (2) It provides an additional time series
                   of ice area and extent for climate studies.},

                   of critical importance for sea-ice associated
                   organisms and photosynthesis because light is their
                   primary energy source. The amount of visible light
                   transferred through sea ice contributes to the energy
                   budget of the sea ice and the uppermost ocean.
                   However, our current knowledge on the amount and
                   distribution of light under sea ice is still
                   restricted to a few local observations, and our
                   understanding of light-driven processes and
                   interdisciplinary interactions is still sparse. The
                   main reasons are that the under-ice environment is
                   difficult to access and that measurements require
                   large logistical and instrumental efforts. Hence, it
                   has not been possible to map light conditions under
                   sea ice over larger areas and to quantify spatial
                   variability on different scales. Here we present a
                   detailed methodological description for operating
                   spectral radiometers on a remotely operated vehicle
                   (ROV) under sea ice. Recent advances in ROV and
                   radiation-sensor technology have allowed us to map
                   under-ice spectral radiance and irradiance on floe
                   scales within a few hours of station time. The ROV
                   was operated directly from the sea ice, allowing for
                   direct relations of optical properties to other
                   sea-ice and surface features. The ROV was flown close
                   to the sea ice in order to capture small-scale
                   variability. Results from the presented data set and
                   similar future studies will allow for better
                   quantification of light conditions under sea ice. The
                   presented experiences will support further
                   developments in order to gather large data sets of
                   under-ice radiation for different ice conditions and

                   (DMS) photolysis were determined from Sargasso Sea
                   seawater with the goal of assessing the extent to
                   which photoreactions affect the unusually elevated
                   upper ocean concentrations of DMS during the summer,
                   the so-called DMS summer paradox. Apparent quantum
                   yields determined with monochromatic radiation
                   decrease exponentially with increasing wavelength and
                   indicate that DMS photolysis is driven by ultraviolet
                   (UV) radiation. The relative spectral partitioning
                   differs between samples collected from the surface
                   mixed layer (15 m) and from the chlorophyll a maximum
                   (80 m), presumably because of differences in
                   chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) quality
                   (e.g., apparent degree of bleaching). Quantum yields
                   are also temperature dependent, and an approximate
                   doubling of photolysis rates occurs for a 208C
                   increase in temperature. The significance of DMS
                   photolysis to upper ocean sulfur budgets is explored
                   using a multiyear (1992– 1994) DMS time series,
                   concurrent irradiance determinations and temperature
                   profiles, and estimates of CDOM absorption.
                   Depth-integrated, mixed-layer DMS photolysis rates
                   peak in the summer (15–25 mmol m22 d21) and decline
                   to ,1 mmol m22 d21 in the winter. These rates
                   correspond to specific turnover rates of ;0.29 d21 in
                   the summer and ,0.02 d21 in the winter. Seasonal
                   changes in solar radiation, temperature, and DMS
                   concentrations drive the 30-fold differences in
                   photolysis rates, overshadowing differences caused by
                   photosensitizer (CDOM) quantity or quality
                   (21–35{\%}). These results demonstrate that
                   although photolysis is not the primary driver of the
                   summer paradox, it makes an important contribution to
                   the time–depth pattern of DMS concentrations
                   observed in the Sargasso Sea.},

                   a significant impact on Arctic marine ecosystems.
                   Ice-associated fauna play a key role in this context
                   because they constitute a unique part of Arctic
                   biodiversity and transmit carbon from sea-ice algae
                   into pelagic and benthic food webs. Our study
                   presents the first regional-scale record of under-ice
                   faunal distribution and the environmental
                   characteristics of under-ice habitats throughout the
                   Eurasian Basin. Sampling was conducted with a Surface
                   and Under-Ice Trawl, equipped with a sensor array
                   recording ice thickness and other physical parameters
                   during trawling. We identified 2 environmental
                   regimes, broadly coherent with the Nansen and
                   Amundsen Basins. The Nansen Basin regime was
                   distinguished from the Amundsen Basin regime by
                   heavier sea-ice conditions, higher surface salinities
                   and higher nitrate + nitrite concentrations. We found
                   a diverse (28 species) under-ice community throughout
                   the Eurasian Basin. Change in community structure
                   reflected differences in the relative contribution of
                   abundant species. Copepods (Calanus hyperboreus and
                   C. glacialis) dominated in the Nansen Basin regime.
                   In the Amundsen Basin regime, amphipods (Apherusa
                   glacialis, Themisto libellula) dominated. Polar cod
                   Boreogadus saida was present throughout the sampling
                   area. Abrupt changes from a dominance of
                   ice-associated amphipods at ice-covered stations to a
                   dominance of pelagic amphipods (T. libellula) at
                   nearby ice-free stations emphasised the decisive
                   influence of sea ice on small-scale patterns in the
                   surface-layer community. The observed response in
                   community composition to different environmental
                   regimes indicates potential long-term alterations in
                   Arctic marine ecosystems as the Arctic Ocean
                   continues to change.},

  abstract =      {In spite of its harsh climate, the Antarctic Seasonal
                   Sea Ice Zone (SIZ) is remarkably diverse and hosts
                   globally significant fisheries resources, such as the
                   Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). The species
                   community of the ice-water interface layer is assumed
                   to be fundamental to the food web of the Antarctic
                   SIZ. A novel sampling device was developed to
                   investigate this barely accessible community, the
                   Surface and Under Ice Trawl (SUIT). Investigations
                   with SUIT yielded the first large-scale evidence that
                   life under Antarctic pack-ice is surprisingly diverse
                   and abundant. Especially Antarctic krill was closely
                   associated with the underside of sea ice. Comparison
                   with deeper-fishing nets indicated that krill often
                   concentrate closely under ice floes and are less
                   abundant in the water column. Thus, the midwater
                   sampling usually applied for krill stock estimates
                   probably under-estimates the abundance of krill in
                   pack-ice. The importance of sea ice also for large
                   animals was highlighted by a penguin and seal survey
                   finding that the distribution of crabeater seals
                   (Lobodon carcinophaga) was closely related to ice
                   thickness and ocean depth. Furthermore,
                   investigations on the energy content and distribution
                   of fishes in offshore waters suggested that certain
                   fishes can be equally important to krill in the food
                   web of the Antarctic SIZ. These results challenge the
                   classic krill-centered concept of the Antarctic food
                   web. These findings can help to better estimate the
                   response of Antarctic marine ecosystems to changing
                   sea ice characteristics caused by global warming and
                   are relevant for fisheries management and
                   conservation in Antarctica.},

  abstract =      {The Arctic icescape is rapidly transforming from a
                   thicker multiyear ice cover to a thinner and largely
                   seasonal first-year ice cover with significant
                   consequences for Arctic primary production. One
                   critical challenge is to understand how productivity
                   will change within the next decades. Recent studies
                   have reported extensive phytoplankton blooms beneath
                   ponded sea ice during summer, indicating that
                   satellite-based Arctic annual primary production
                   estimates may be significantly underestimated. Here
                   we present a unique time-series of a phytoplankton
                   spring bloom observed beneath snow-covered Arctic
                   pack ice. The bloom, dominated by the haptophyte
                   algae Phaeocystis pouchetii, caused near depletion of
                   the surface nitrate inventory and a decline in
                   dissolved inorganic carbon by 16 ± 6 g C m −2 .
                   Ocean circulation characteristics in the area
                   indicated that the bloom developed in situ despite
                   the snow-covered sea ice. Leads in the dynamic ice
                   cover provided added sunlight necessary to initiate
                   and sustain the bloom. Phytoplankton blooms beneath
                   snow-covered ice might become more common and
                   widespread in the future Arctic Ocean with frequent
                   lead formation due to thinner and more dynamic sea
                   ice despite projected increases in high-Arctic
                   snowfall. This could alter productivity, marine food
                   webs and carbon sequestration in the Arctic Ocean.
                   Annual phytoplankton net primary production in the
                   Arctic Ocean has increased by 30{\%} since the late
                   1990's mainly due to the declining sea ice extent and
                   an increasing phytoplankton growth season},

  year =          {2013},
  abstract =      {The spatial and seasonal magnitude and variability of
                   primary production in the Arctic Ocean (AO) is
                   quantified with a pan-arctic approach. We synthesize
                   estimates of primary production (PP), focusing on
                   surface waters (0–5m), using complementary methods
                   that emphasize different spatial and temporal scales.
                   These methods include (1) in situ observations of 14C
                   uptake mostly and possibly some O2 production
                   reported in units of carbon (in situ PP), (2)
                   remotely sensed primary production (sat-PP), and (3)
                   an empirical algorithm giving net PP as a function of
                   in situ chlorophyll a (in situ Chl-PP). The work
                   presented herein examines historical data for PP
                   collected in surface waters only, as they form the
                   majority of the values of a larger ensemble of PP
                   data collected over {\textgreater}50years (ARCSS-PP)
                   by many national and international efforts. This
                   extended set of surface and vertically-resolved data
                   will provide pan-Arctic validation of remotely sensed
                   chlorophyll a and PP, an extremely valuable tool in
                   this environment which is so difficult to sample. To
                   this day, PP data in the AO are scarce and have
                   uneven temporal and spatial coverage which, when
                   added to the AO's regional heterogeneity, its strong
                   seasonal changes, and limited access, have made and
                   continue to make obtaining a comprehensive picture of
                   PP in the AO difficult. Daily surface in situ PP
                   averaged 70 and 21mgCm−3d−1 for spring and
                   summer, respectively, for the ca. 50year period
                   across the AO. Average daily estimates of in situ PP
                   in surface waters on a pan-Arctic basis were several
                   fold higher with respect to remotely sensed PP
                   (sat-PP) and in situ chlorophyll-derived PP (Chl-PP)
                   in the spring period, likely due to differences in
                   data availability and coverage. Summer daily averages
                   for surface in situ PP and sat-PP were similar and
                   twice as high as in situ Chl-PP. Differences among
                   annual estimates of surface in situ PP, in situ
                   Chl-PP and sat-PP across the Arctic Ocean are
                   presented and discussed. The mode of all three
                   differences was 0mg Cm−3y−1 and the median
                   difference was within ±400mgCm−3y−1. Agreement
                   between annual surface sat-PP and in situ PP was
                   within ±1000mgCm−3y−1 for half of the data. We
                   hope that the entire ARCSS-PP data set, especially if
                   combined with any archiving by the latest IPY effort,
                   will be employed to develop an improved,
                   panarctic-specific PP remote sensing algorithm and to
                   test hypotheses regarding the controls of PP in the
                   AO. Furthermore, the ARCSS-PP is openly available to
                   be used by AO modelers to calibrate, assimilate,
                   validate and compare community ecosystem and
                   biogeochemical numerical models and, when combined
                   with field work, will allow for improved
                   understanding, detection and prediction of long-term
                   biological patterns.},

                   primary production (PP) measurements from the Pacific
                   Arctic Region (PAR), collected between 1950 and 2012.
                   Seasonal integrated primary production (IPP) across
                   the PAR was calculated from 524 profiles, 340 of
                   which were also analyzed to determine the average
                   vertical distribution of PP rates for spring, summer
                   and fall months. The Chirikov Basin and Chukchi Shelf
                   were the most productive areas, with the East
                   Siberian Sea, Chukchi Plateau and Canada Basin the
                   lowest. Decadal-scale changes were indicated in the
                   southern Chukchi Sea, and across Hanna Shoal. In the
                   southern Chukchi Sea in August, IPP increased
                   significantly from 113±35mgCm-2 d-1 in 1959 and 1960
                   to 833±307mgCm-2 d-1 in the 2000s. Increases in the
                   magnitude of IPP were accompanied by variations in
                   the vertical distribution, the subsurface peak
                   observed in the 1959/60 was not present in the 2000s.
                   The mechanism behind this change was undetermined but
                   could have included changes in stratification, mixing
                   or surface distribution of water masses as well as
                   methodological differences. Over Hanna Shoal, the
                   phytoplankton surface bloom now occurs earlier by
                   several weeks compared to 1993, linked to increases
                   in light due to earlier sea- ice retreat. In 1993
                   with sea ice still present in the region the surface
                   bloom occurred in August, in 2002 and 2004 this same
                   period was characterized by open water and low
                   surface PP and strong subsurface production. This
                   dataset provides a region-wide quantification of IPP
                   and decadal trends and highlights the need for a
                   cooperative monitoring program to observe the
                   long-term impacts of climate change in the Arctic
                   ecosystem.},

  abstract =      {Abstract. The ice-covered central Arctic Ocean is
                   characterized by low primary productivity due to
                   light and nutrient limitations. The recent reduction
                   in ice cover has the potential to substantially
                   increase phytoplankton primary production, but little
                   is yet known about the fate of the ice-associated
                   primary production and of the nutrient supply with
                   increasing warming. This study presents results from
                   the central Arctic Ocean collected during summer
                   2012, when sea-ice extent reached its lowest ever
                   recorded since the onset of satellite observations.
                   Net primary productivity (NPP) was measured in the
                   water column, sea ice and melt ponds by 14CO2 uptake
                   at different irradiances. Photosynthesis vs.
                   irradiance (PI) curves were established in laboratory
                   experiments and used to upscale measured NPP to the
                   deep Eurasian Basin (north of 78° N) using the
                   irradiance-based Central Arctic Ocean Primary
                   Productivity (CAOPP) model. In addition, new annual
                   production has been calculated from the seasonal
                   nutrient drawdown in the mixed layer since last
                   winter. Results show that ice algae can contribute up
                   to 60{\%} to primary production in the central Arctic
                   Ocean at the end of the productive season
                   (August–September). The ice-covered water column
                   has lower NPP rates than open water due to light
                   limitation in late summer. As indicated by the
                   nutrient ratios in the euphotic zone, nitrate was
                   limiting primary production in the deep Eurasian
                   Basin close to the Laptev Sea area, while silicate
                   was the main limiting nutrient at the ice margin near
                   the Atlantic inflow. Although sea-ice cover was
                   substantially reduced in 2012, total annual new
                   production in the Eurasian Basin was 17 ± 7 Tg C
                   yr−1, which is within the range of estimates of
                   previous years. However, when adding the contribution
                   by sub-ice algae, the annual production for the deep
                   Eurasian Basin (north of 78° N) could double
                   previous estimates for that area with a surplus of 16
                   Tg C yr−1. Our data suggest that sub-ice algae are
                   an important component of the productivity in the
                   ice-covered Eurasian Basin of the central Arctic
                   Ocean. It remains an important question whether their
                   contribution to productivity is on the rise with
                   thinning ice, or whether it will decline due to
                   overall sea-ice retreat and be replaced by
                   phytoplankton.},

                   afforded little attention in global-or even
                   basin-scale ecosystem modelling studies. Due to
                   anthropogenic climate change however, the sea ice

                   this decline in sea-ice is liable to encourage
                   pronounced growth of phytoplankton in summer and
                   poses pressing questions concerning the future of
                   Arctic ecosystems. It thus provides a strong impetus
                   to modelling of this region. The Arctic Ocean is an
                   area where plankton productivity is heavily
                   influenced by physical factors. As these factors are
                   strongly responding to climate change, we analyse
                   here the results from simulations of the 1/4 •
                   resolution global ocean NEMO (Nucleus for European
                   Modelling of the Ocean) model coupled with the MEDUSA
                   (Model for Ecosystem Dynamics, carbon Utilisation,
                   Sequestration and Acidification) biogeochemical
                   model, with a particular focus on the Arctic basin.
                   Simulated productivity is consistent with the limited
                   observations for the Arctic, with significant
                   production occurring both under the sea-ice and at
                   the ther-mocline, locations that are difficult to
                   sample in the field. Results also indicate that a
                   substantial fraction of the variability in Arctic
                   primary production can be explained by two key
                   physical factors: (i) the maximum penetration of
                   winter mixing, which determines the amount of
                   nutrients available for summer primary production,
                   and (ii) shortwave radiation at the ocean surface,
                   which controls the magnitude of phytoplankton blooms.

  abstract =      {Assessing the role of sea ice algal biomass and
                   primary production for polar ecosystems remains
                   challenging due to the strong spatio-temporal
                   variability of sea ice algae. Therefore, the spatial
                   representativeness of sea ice algal biomass and
                   primary production sampling remains a key issue in
                   large-scale models and climate change predictions of
                   polar ecosystems. To address this issue, we presented
                   two novel approaches to up-scale ice algal chl a
                   biomass and net primary production estimates based on
                   profiles covering distances of 100 to 1000s of
                   meters. This was accomplished by combining ice
                   core-based methods with horizontal under-ice spectral
                   radiation profiling conducted in the central Arctic
                   Ocean during summer 2012. We conducted a multi-scale
                   comparison of ice-core based ice algal chl a biomass
                   with two profiling platforms: a remotely operated
                   vehicle and surface and under ice trawl (SUIT). Net
                   primary production estimates were compared between
                   ice cores and remotely operated vehicle surveys. Our
                   results showed that ice core-based estimates of ice
                   algal biomass and net primary production do not
                   representatively capture the spatial variability
                   compared to the remotely operated vehicle-based
                   estimates, implying considerable uncertainties for
                   pan-Arctic estimates based on ice core observations
                   alone. Grouping sea ice cores based on region or ice
                   type improved the representativeness. With only a
                   small sample size, however, a high risk of obtaining
                   non-representative estimates remains. Sea ice algal
                   biomass estimates based on the dominant ice class
                   alone showed a better agreement between ice core and
                   remotely operated vehicle estimates. Grouping ice
                   core measurements yielded no improvement in net
                   primary production estimates, highlighting the
                   importance of accounting for the spatial variability
                   of both the chl a biomass and bottom-ice light in
                   order to get representative estimates. Profile-based
                   measurements of ice algae biomass identified sea ice
                   ridges as an underappreciated component of the Arctic
                   ecosystem because chl a biomass was significantly
                   greater in this unique habitat. Sea ice ridges are
                   not easily captured with ice coring methods and thus
                   require more attention in future studies. Based on
                   our results, we provide recommendations for designing
                   an efficient and effective sea ice algal sampling
                   program for the summer season.},

                   wind-driven free drift of sea ice that allows for an
                   arbitrary mixture of ice and open water. The model
                   includes an ice{\&}ndash;ocean boundary layer with an
                   Ekman spiral, forced by transfers of wind-input
                   momentum both through the sea ice and directly into
                   the open water between the ice floes. The analytical
                   tractability of this model allows efficient
                   calculation of the ice velocity provided that the
                   surface wind field is known and that the ocean
                   geostrophic velocity is relatively weak. The model
                   predicts that variations in the ice thickness or
                   concentration should substantially modify the
                   rotation of the velocity between the 10m winds, the
                   sea ice, and the ocean. Compared to recent
                   observational data from the first ice-tethered
                   profiler with a velocity sensor (ITP-V), the model is
                   able to capture the dependencies of the ice speed and
                   the wind/ice/ocean turning angles on the wind speed.
                   The model is used to derive responses to intensified
                   southerlies on Arctic summer sea ice concentration,
                   and the results are shown to compare closely with

  abstract =      {The Canadian Beaufort Sea has been categorized as an
                   oligotrophic system with the potential for enhanced
                   production due to a nutrient-rich intermediate layer
                   of Pacific-origin waters. Using under-ice
                   hydrographic data collected near the ice-edge of a
                   shallow Arctic bay, we documented an ice-edge
                   upwelling event that brought nutrient-rich waters to
                   the surface during June 2008. The event resulted in a
                   3-week long phytoplankton bloom that produced an
                   estimated 31 g C m(-2) of new production. This value
                   was approximately twice that of previous estimates
                   for annual production in the region, demonstrating
                   the importance of ice-edge upwelling to the local
                   marine ecosystem. Under-ice primary production
                   estimates of up to 0.31 g C m(-2) d(-1) showed that
                   this production was not negligible, contributing up
                   to 22{\%} of the daily averaged production of the
                   ice-edge bloom. It is suggested that under-ice blooms
                   are a widespread yet under-documented phenomenon in

                   were assessed in the Northeast Water Polynya during
                   July-August 1992 by using super(14)C and super(15)N
                   tracer techniques. The average rate of primary
                   production for the entire region, including an
                   approximate correction for the effects of ice cover,
                   was 0.21 g C m super(-2) d super(-1), with the
                   maximum observed rate being slightly over 1.1 g C m
                   super(-2) d super(-1). Rates of new production
                   (uncorrected for effects of ice cover) averaged 3.08
                   mmol N m super(-2) d super(-1). Surface f ratios (the
                   ratio between nitrate uptake and the total inorganic
                   nitrate uptake) averaged 0.63, and depth-integrated f
                   ratios equaled 0.69. It appeared that the water
                   column in general was bilayered, in that f ratios
                   were reduced near the surface in low (less than 2 mu
                   M) nitrate waters and increased deeper in the
                   euphotic zone. Ammonium concentrations and uptake
                   were consistently low throughout the region. Growth
                   rates were modest, with surface growth rates
                   averaging 0.33 per day. A simple relationship among
                   the attenuation of solar radiation by sea ice (and
                   its associated snow cover and microbial community),
                   the percentage of open water, ice thickness, water
                   column attenuation, and phytoplankton photosynthesis
                   is described. The relationship is nonlinear, but, in
                   general, nutrient-replete water column photosynthesis
                   are largely a function of the percentage of open
                   water rather than ice thickness. Both irradiance and
                   nutrient fields exert strong influences on
                   phytoplankton productivity and ultimately result in a
                   mosaic of biomass within the polynya.},

                   algal biomass (Chlorophyll $\alpha$) and primary
                   production were measured in the water column, at the
                   ice-water interface and in the bottom 2-4 cm of the
                   sea ice along a transect from the Chukchi Sea to the
                   Nansen Basin via the North Pole. Algal biomass and
                   primary production were determined for 0.7-5 $\mu$m
                   and {\textgreater} 5 $\mu$m size fractions. The algal
                   release rate of DO14C during incubation was also
                   measured. In the Chukchi Sea and in leads of the
                   Makarov and Nansen Basins, total maximum particulate
                   phytoplankton production rates were 2570, 73 and 521
                   mg C m-2day-1, respectively. At those stations, where
                   ice cover varied from 55 to 90{\%}, large
                   phytoplankton ({\textgreater} 5 $\mu$m) represented
                   61-98{\%} of the total algal biomass. At stations
                   with higher ice coverage ({\textgreater}90{\%}), the
                   total phytoplankton production decreased to 9-57 mg C
                   m-2day-1. At these stations, small phytoplankton
                   (0.7-5 $\mu$m) accounted for 59-88{\%} of the total
                   biomass and more than 64{\%} of the total production.
                   Along the transect, the percentage of the total
                   phytoplankton production released as extracellular
                   carbon was generally less than 20{\%}, except in the
                   Canadian Basin where it ranged from 31 to 65{\%}.
                   Total particulate ice algal production ranged from
                   0.5 to 310 mg C m-2day-1and showed maximum rates in
                   the central Arctic Ocean. Large cells ({\textgreater}
                   5 $\mu$m) generally dominated the ice algal
                   community, representing 50-100{\%} of the total
                   biomass and more than 50{\%}, of the total
                   production. Ice algae released on average 34{\%} of
                   total carbon fixed during the 4-12 h incubation. Ice
                   algae contributed on average 57{\%} of the entire
                   primary production (water column + sea ice) in the
                   central Arctic and 3{\%} in the surrounding regions.
                   Total primary productivity in the central Arctic
                   Ocean is estimated at 15 g C m-2year-1, a value at
                   least 10 times higher than previously reported. The
                   difference between estimates is due in part to the
                   previously unmeasured contribution of the particulate
                   production by ice algae and the release of DOC by
                   both ice and pelagic algae.},

                   the high productivity and biogeochemical cycling of
                   carbon in the North Water Polynya (NOW), we
                   determined physical properties and nutrient
                   concentrations of the upper water column, and
                   phytoplankton production, during spring/summer (April
                   to July) 1998. Phytoplankton production of total
                   organic carbon (P-TOC) was partitioned into
                   production of dissolved and particulate organic
                   carbon (P-DOC and P-POC, respectively), the latter
                   being further partitioned into production of large
                   and small phytoplankton (P-L and P-S, respectively)
                   using 5 mum as threshold. The highest P-TOC was 6 g C
                   m(-2) d(-1) at peak bloom. The fraction of P-DOC in
                   P-TOC was lower in periods of high P-TOC than those
                   of low P-TOC. Averaged over the whole polynya for the
                   sampling period, P-DOC and P-POC accounted for 34 and
                   66{\%} of the fixed carbon, respectively, and 81 and
                   19{\%} of P-POC were in the P-L and P-S fractions,
                   respectively. Variations in the integrated
                   assimilation numbers of large and small phytoplankton
                   were mostly explained by nutrients and irradiance.
                   Even though P-POC was dominated by large
                   phytoplankton, the sinking rates of the phytoplankton
                   cells were relatively low (0 to 0.7 m d-1), hence low
                   export of P-POC to depth (17{\%}), and relatively
                   high potential transfer to large pelagic organisms
                   through the herbivorous food web. This explains why
                   the NOW is a major feeding and spawning area for
                   fish, mammals and birds.},
