				\begin{itemize}
					\justifying
					\setlength\itemsep{1.5em}
					\item Estimating primary production from photosynthetic parameters and transmittance measured at a single location does not provide a representative description of the spatial variability of the primary production occurring under a heterogeneous sea surface.
					\item Combining photosynthetic parameters measured in laboratory experiments with spatially representative transmittance values sampled with under-ice profiling platforms can significantly improve the accuracy of primary production estimates under heterogeneous sea surfaces.
					\item Spatially extensive in situ measurements must be combined with large-footprint sea-ice coverage sampling (e.g., remote sensing, aerial imagery) to accurately estimate primary production in ice-covered waters at larger scales.
				\end{itemize}
			\end{alertblock}


			\begin{block}{Problematics \& objectives}
				\begin{itemize}
					\justifying
					\setlength\itemsep{1.5em}
					\item During the last decades, the arctic icescape has been undergoing major changes, including a reduction of sea ice cover and thickness, and increased drift speed.
					\item Because of this surface heterogeneity, light transmittance can be highly variable in space, even over short distances.
					\item In such environments, phytoplankton is exposed to a highly variable light regime while drifting under a spatially heterogeneous. \textbf{Therefore, local irradiance measurements are not representative of the average irradiance experienced by phytoplankton over a large area.}
					\item \textit{Objective 1:} evaluate the potential of different underwater technologies to characterize the horizontal spatial variability of light transmittance at the ice-water interface (Figure 1).
					\item \textit{Objective 2:} use these transmittance data to assess the sensitivity of water-column primary production estimates to multi-scale under-ice light measurements.

				\textcolor{blue}{\large \textbf{ROV and SUIT transmittance measurements} (Figure 2)}

				\begin{itemize}
					\justifying
					\setlength\itemsep{1.5em}
					\item Transmittance values ranged between 0.001\% and 68\% for the ROV and between 0.002\% and 92\% for the SUIT.
					\item The transmittances measured by the SUIT were generally higher (mean = 35\%) by approximately one order magnitude than those measured with the ROV (mean = 2\%).

					\item At stations 19 and 27, greater differences between \ppunderice{} and \ppmixing{} were observed in ROV-based estimates due to lower sea ice concentrations which allowed for a greater weight of \ppopenwater{} on the calculations.

					\item The absolute relative errors ($\delta_P$) were distributed over a range covering four orders of magnitude, between 0.1\% and 1000\% which is corresponding to absolute primary production error varying between 0.0001 and 640 \dailypp{}.
					\item The lowest absolute errors (average $\approx$50\%) were associated with primary production estimates made using the mixing model approach (\ppmixing{}).

				\footnotesize

				Process studies on biological productivity and ecosystem interactions were carried out north of Spitsbergen during the international Transitions in the Arctic Seasonal Sea Ice Zone (TRANSSIZ) expedition aboard the RV Polarstern (PS92, ARK-XXIX/1) between the 19th of May and the 26th June of 2015. In total, seven process studies (stations 19 27, 31, 39, 43, 46 and 47) were carried out where the ship was anchored to an ice floe, typically for 36 hours.

				\textcolor{blue}{\textbf{Light measurements \& estimating primary production}}

				\begin{itemize}
					\justifying
					\item Snow/sea-ice transmittance measurements were acquired at different spatial scales using a \textbf{Remotely Operated Vehicle, ROV} and a \textbf{Surface and Under-Ice Trawl, SUIT} (see Figure 1).
					\item Incident in-air downward photosynthetically active radiation, \eparzero{} (\micromol{}), was propagated into the water column using the downward diffuse attenuation coefficient of PAR calculated from the ROV.
					\item Primary production was then calculated using photosynthetic parameters derived from seawater samples incubated with 14\textsuperscript{C}-labelled sodium bicarbonate.
				\end{itemize}

				Two different approaches were used to calculate primary production from estimated photosynthetic parameters.

				\begin{itemize}
					\justifying
					\item \textit{Method 1: under-ice only primary production}: \eparscalar{} was propagated in the water column only under the ice using the transmittance values derived from either the ROV or the SUIT. Daily and depth-integrated primary production, \ppundericedevice{}, was calculated from transmittance measurements derived from both ROV and SUIT.
					\item \textit{Method 2: average production under ice and adjacent open waters} - The second approach consisted of using a mixing model, \ppmixingdevice{}, based on sea ice concentration (SIC) averaged over an area of $\approx$ 350 km\textsuperscript{2} derived from satellite imagery to upscale at a larger spatial scale the estimates of primary production derived from the ROV and the SUIT.
				\end{itemize}
