abstract = {A method is presented for the determination of algae photosynthetic rate as a function of incident irradiance. The method uses small volumes (1 ml), short incubation times (20 min) and provides sufficient data (36 pairs) for objective analysis. Data from laboratory and natural algal populations are used to illustrate application with particular attention to the response of parameters of photosynthesis-irradiance relationships to short-time scale variations in incident irradiance such as might be experienced in a mixing water column.},
